## How it started off

The very first rendition of this website was actually quite impressive. It conveyed my own personal sense of professionalism perfectly, and you truly must [visit to fully appreciate it](/old).

## Research

I don't remember how, but I was at some point linked to [Alex Cican's blog post about hosting his personal website with Dropbox through Scriptogram](http://alexcican.com/post/blog-dropbox-scriptogram). At the bottom of his post is a disclaimer that he is now using Jekyll instead of Scriptogram. Since his website's design is superb, I figured emulating him wouldn't be too bad of an idea.

## Initial struggles

Jekyll's base theme was fugly, so I tried integrating Bootstrap. I was in way over my head. I had no idea what to do with all the css and javascript on offer, so I just futzed around aimlessly with their canonical examples. In the end I put an F-22 in the background and gave up.

## Flex

Eventually, I had the bright idea of Googling "Jekyll Themes", and found Flex, the theme upon which this website is currently based. Then I modified the templates to fit my needs, and this is what you see before you today. Work in progress.
